# Name

The name of this organization ("The Club") is the "University of Waterloo Game Development Club"

# Statement of Independance

The Club is not an agent or representative of the Federation of Students ("The Federation"). Its views and actions are in no way representative of The Federation.

# Purpose

The purpose of The Club is to build a community of game developers on campus. It should encourage participants from a diverse set of fields, including but not limited to visual artistis, musicians, programmers, designers, writers, and critics. The Club should create a safe space for this community, and encourage its members to realize their ambitions. By bringing these people together, members can learn from each other and walk away as better creators.

# Membership

Membership is open to students of the University of Waterloo, faculty, and interested members of the community.

A voting member is a member who has attended at least one meeting in the last four, not including the currently active meeting.

The club will hold records of attendance to determine who is eligable to be a voting member. It is up to members to ensure they sign in, and the records will be the final authority on who is a voting member.

Only members which are University of Waterloo students are eligable to be executives. Voting membership is not required.

# Executive

## Basic Structure and Duties

The Executive is a body is made up of a President and up to four Councillors. Together they are responsible for all decisions made by the club. These decisions include, but are not limited to

* What events the club shall run
* What club funds should be spent on
* The appointment of advisors

## Decision Making

In general the Executive will make decisions through discussion and consensus. In the case where this does not work, any executive may call for a vote. Executives should avoid calling votes if at all possible.

If there is a vote, a decision is made by a majority of executives. Unless otherwise noted a President can veto a decision so long as at least one Councillor seconds the veto.

## Changes to the Executive

The Executive may vote to remove or add Councillors, as long as the number of Councillors does not exceed the maximum stated above.

The Executive may vote to remove the President. The President can not veto this vote.

If the club is ever without a President, a vote for a new President must be held within two weeks. The election process is outlined below.

If there are ever fewer than two Councillors, the President may appoint Councillors until there are at least two. After this new Councillors can only be added by a vote.

The President may pass their title, at any time, onto another Councillor. The former President is now a Councillor.

Any Executive may forfeight their position at any time.

## Advisors

At their leisure the President may appoint a number of advisors. Advisors can not cast votes, but must be involved in discussions by the Executive.

Any member is eligable to be an Advisor.

# Membership Fees

There are no fees associated with membership.

# Meetings

Club meetings are held once a week. In order for decisions to be made by voting members, at least five voting members must be in attendance.

Notice of meetings or votes are sent through The Club's mailing list. This mailing list is open to all members.

# Elections

Elections for President are held during club meetings. Any member can nominate candidates for Presidency.

Nominees must be members who are students at the University of Waterloo.

Only voting members may cast votes for President.

The President with the most votes is elected into office.

Notice for an election must be given at least two weeks before it is held. Nominations can occur up to and dring the meeting in which the election is held.

# Vote of No Confidence

Ten voting members or two Executives can call for a Vote of No Confidence. Within two weeks a vote of all voting members must be held. If a super majority (2/3) of those who vote vote in favour of No Confidence, then the entire Executive is dissolved. Since this leaves The Club without a President, a vote is triggered (as above). The new President would then appoint two new Councillors (also as above).

# Amendment

Any amendment to this Constitution requires two weeks notice to voting members. A supermajority (2/3) of voting members who have cast a vote must vote in favour for an amendment to be passed.

# Affiliation

The Club enjoys a positive relationship with the University of Waterloo Games Institute. The Games Institute offers space for The Club while The Club runs events that forward the goals of the Institute.
