#### Purpose

One of the primary goals of the Game Development Club of the University of Waterloo is the inclusion and support of all members of the University of Waterloo community who are interested in Game Development. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sex, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and religion or lack thereof.

We invite all those who participate in our events and who communicate with our Club at large to help us create a safe and positive experience for everyone involved.

We've outlined a code of conduct to highlight our expectations for all individuals who participate in our Club, as well as the steps to handle unacceptable behaviour.

#### Expected Behaviour

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this Club.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

#### Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviours include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of Club business. Club event venues may be shared; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

#### Experiencing Unexpected Behaviour

The Club Executive are herein referred to as the Officers, or singularly as Officer.

If you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, contact an Officer. No situation is considered inconsequential. If you do not feel comfortable contacting an Executive Council member due to the nature of the incident, you may contact the Faculty Advisor.

Upon receiving a complaint the Officer will inform the first of the following people who is not personally involved in the situation, or in a close relationship with the someone involved in the situation and is available, and this person shall handle the complaint and shall here after be referred to as the Handling Officer.

* The President
* The Vice President
* Any other Executive Council Member
* The Faculty Advisor

The Handling Officer will interview the subject of the complaint and any witnesses and consult with other relevant Officers. The Handling Officer shall always consult with at least one other Officer.

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

After having done so, the Handling Officer shall use their best judgment to determine if the complaint is valid and, if so, determine with the relevant Officers the appropriate action to ensure that the complainant feels welcome in the Game Development Club and to avoid a subsequent incident:

* A warning.
* A suspension from the events and spaces governed by the Code of Conduct until the beginning of the next term. If the suspension would come into effect less than two full weeks from the end of classes in the current term, then the suspension applies to the subsequent term as well.
* If the incident is very serious, or the subject has a pattern of similar offences, expulsion from the Club.
* The Handling Officer shall inform the complainant of the resolution of the issue and inform both the complainant and the subject of their right to appeal the decision.

#### Addressing Grievances

If either the complainant or the subject disagree with the decision made by the Handling Officer, they can appeal to the Officers, who can overturn the decision with a majority vote of all the Officers.

No Officer who was personally involved in the complaint, or is in a close relationship with someone involved in the complaint, shall participate in the Officers deliberation or vote on the appeal.

If the subject of a complaint is expelled from the Club, then at their request, but no more often than once a year, the Officers will review the decision to expel them from the Club. The Officers can reinstate the subject with a two-thirds vote of the Officers.

#### Confidentiality

The Club recognizes that all members have a right to privacy, and will handle complaints confidentially.

Information that will be kept in Club records and be available to Officers in the future will be limited to: the date the complaint was made, the name of the subject of the complaint, the name of the Handling Officer, the decision made on the complaint, the date the decision on the complaint was made, and if applicable, the date of the appeal, the party making the appeal (Complainant or Subject), the decision made on the appeal by the Officers, and the date of the Officers decision on the appeal.

The information the Handling Officer will keep records of, in addition to the information kept in the Club records, will be limited to : the name of the complainant, and a summary of the complaint. This information will be available to Officers that are handling future complaints if it is requested and the Handling Officer deems it relevant to the new complaint.

#### Scope

We expect all Club participants (participants, organizers, sponsors, and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues (online and in-person) as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to Club business.
Events co-organized with the Computer Science Club are governed by our Code of Conduct.

#### Contact Information

The Computer Science Club Officers can be contacted as a whole.

#### Additional Information

Additionally, the Executive Council are available to help Club members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behaviour feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.
